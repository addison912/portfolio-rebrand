        <div class="section-body">
          Plate Tracker is a React-Native mobile application built around the
          OpenALPR library (Automatic License Plate Recognition). It allows
          users to scan vehicle license plates and automatically check them
          against a database of over 12000 stolen vehicles. Users can register
          their stolen vehicles in the app and receive a notification if their
          license plate is scanned.

        <div class="section-body">
          I was inspired to build this app when my own motorcycle was stolen. I
          searched the internet for online communities that could support me in
          recovering my vehicle. I found many Facebook pages and bulletin boards
          fractured across the internet where people were posting their stolen
          vehicles and reporting suspicious vehicles but nowhere that all the
          information was shared. There are over 750,000 vehicles stolen in the
          US every year. Until now there was no central resource for people to
          share stolen vehicle information.
